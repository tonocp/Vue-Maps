# Vue_Maps

This is the GitHub repository for this _Vue Maps_ APP made with [VUE](https://v3.vuejs.org/), [VUEX](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/), [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

With this App I can show _My Location_, search places and show different _Markers_ and _Routes_ when you select them. Also it shows the _Distance_ and _Duration_ of the Car Trip.

It's made following the standards of _VUE 3_, modularized and also styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### Right now it's on DEVELOPMENT and ISN'T DEPLOYED
